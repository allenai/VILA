## Overview 

The S2-VLUE, Semantic Scholar **V**isual **L**ayout-enhanced Scientific Text **U**nderstanding **E**valuation (S2-VLUE) Benchmark Suite, is created to evaluate the scientific document understanding and parsing with visual layout information. 

It consists of three datasets, i.e., GROTOAP2, DocBank, and, S2-VL. We modify the existing dataset GROTOAP2[1] and DocBank[2], adding visual layout information and converting them to a format that is compatible with [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/). 
The S2-VL dataset is a newly curated dataset that addresses three major drawbacks in existing work: 1) annotation quality, 2) VILA creation, and 3) domain coverage. 
It contains human annotations for papers from 19 scientific disciplines. 
We provide scripts for downloading the source PDF files as well as converting them to a similar HuggingFace Datasets format. 

## Download & Usage

## Datasets Details 

### The S2-VL dataset

During the data release process, we unfortunately found that a small portion of PDFs in our dataset (22 out of 87) had additional copyright constraints of which we had been unaware. This meant that we could not directly release the data corresponding to these papers. As such, in the downloaded version, it contains only paper data created from the 65 papers. 

If you are interested in the version of the dataset used for training and evaluation in our paper, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/M1g9tQLrUtKSsDYA7) to request access. 

#### Recreating the dataset from PDFs and annotations

We also provide the full code to help you recreate the dataset from PDFs and annotation files to the JSON files for training models. Please check the instructions in [s2-vl-utils/README.md](s2-vl-utils/README.md).

#### Dataset Curation Details 

Please find a detailed description of the labeling schemas and categories in the following documents:
- [Labeling Instruction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DsIDKNEi8GBxrqQuYRy86lCKhksgvyRaGhXPCheGgG0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [S2-VL Category Definition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1frGmzYOHnVRWAwTOuuPfc3KVAwu-XKdkFSbpLfy78RI/edit?usp=sharing)
  - We labeled both layout and semantic categories in S2-VL (see the document above), but only the 16 Layout categories will be used in this evaluation benchmark.

### File Structures 

1. The organization of the dataset files :
    ```bash
    grotoap2 # Docbank is similar 
    ├─ labels.json       
    ├─ train-token.json
    ├─ dev-token.json           
    ├─ test-token.json           
    └─ train-test-split.json
    ```
2. What's in each file?
    1. `labels.json`
        ```json
        {"0": "Title",
         "1": "Author",
         ...
        }
        ```
    2. `train-test-split.json`
        ```json
        {
            "train": [
                "pdf-file-name", ...
            ],
            "test": ["pdf-file-name", ...]
        }
        ```
    3. `train-token.json`, `dev-token.json` or `test-token.json`
        Please see detailed schema explanation in the [schema-token.json](schema-token.json) file.
3. Special notes on the folder structure for S2-VL: since the dataset size is small, we use 5-fold cross validation in the paper. The released version has a similar structure: 
    ```bash
    s2-vl-ver1
    ├─ 0  # 5-fold Cross validation                           
    │  ├─ labels.json               
    │  ├─ test-token.json           
    │  ├─ train-test-split.json     
    │  └─ train-token.json          
    ├─ 1  # fold-1, have the same files as other folds                         
    │  ├─ labels.json               
    │  ├─ test-token.json           
    │  ├─ train-test-split.json     
    │  └─ train-token.json          
    ├─ 2                            
    ├─ 3                            
    └─ 4
    ```
